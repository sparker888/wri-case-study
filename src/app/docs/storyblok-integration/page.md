## The power of a Content Management System (CMS)

A CMS is the backbone of any content-driven website, and I'm pleased to work with the Storyblok team. It provides an intuitive interface for non-technical users to contribute content, and have it automatically go live! (Or you can preview a draft first.)

### The Storyblok CMS

Storyblok offers a live-preview editor that makes content creation and management a breeze. Editors can see their changes in real-time, ensuring that what you see is what you get. This immediate feedback is essential for a dynamic system for WRI 2024 speakers, the start of the show.

### It's an Editor's Dream

Storyblok's user-friendly interface is designed for editors to thrive. With drag-and-drop functionality and easy-to-understand controls, creating engaging content is a straightforward process. Check out their [Editors Guide](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/editor-guides/).

### Essentially an Online Text Editor

At its core, Storyblok functions like an advanced online text editor, but with the power to control a website's structure. Its rich-text editing capabilities allow for the inclusion of various media types, making content on the WRI 2024 site vibrant and engaging.
