Empowering content creators is at the forefront of any solid web marketing strategy. By leveraging an innovative, modern Content Management System (CMS) like Storyblok, WRI 2024 speaker content can now be updated by anyone, without the need for a web developer. It's powerful and crucial for great marketing as it not only saves time and resources but makes content updating timely and relevant.

## The Power of a Content Management System (CMS)

A CMS is the backbone of any content-driven website, and I'm pleased to work with the Storyblok team to now integrate it into an event site. Storyblok provides an intuitive interface for non-technical users to contribute and manage content, and have it automatically go live when you publish a particular block of content!

### The Storyblok CMS

Storyblok offers a live-preview editor that makes content creation and management a breeze. Editors can see their changes in real-time, ensuring that what you see is what you get. This immediate feedback is essential for a dynamic system for WRI 2024 speakers, the stars of the show.

### It's an Editor's Dream

Storyblok's user-friendly interface is designed for editors to thrive. With drag-and-drop functionality and easy-to-understand controls, creating engaging content is a straightforward process. Check out their [Editors Guide](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/editor-guides/).

I've rigorously tested Storyblok in the context of the WRI 2024 project, ensuring that it meets high standards for integration and reliability while also staying at a free tier level. The result? A flexible, robust platform that supports every WRI, year after year at zero out of pocket.

Adding speakers is now a breeze on WRI 2024 and future WRI websites. As you can see in this screenshot of speaker Kevin Oldknow, we simply add bio and abstract information into predetermined fields that are available content sections on the website for every speaker.

### Essentially an Online Text Editor

At its core, Storyblok functions like an advanced online text editor, but with the power to control a website's structure. Its rich-text editing capabilities allow for the inclusion of various media types, making content on the WRI 2024 site vibrant and engaging.
