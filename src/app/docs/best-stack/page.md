## WRI 2024 and Google Lighthouse

Jamstack delivers performance, but how do we know it when we see it? Well, for one, the site looks professional. It reacts quickly to inputs. Objects stay in one place when the page loads. The website looks and works well on any device. It's easy to use and many more things. Google went so far as to categorize what factors it considers websites must have to ensure a great user experience.

### The Test Scores

Google Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool designed to improve the quality of web pages. It provides audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and adherence to best practices. 

#### Areas of Measure:

- **Performance** = Measures the speed and overall responsiveness of a website, focusing on the time it takes for content to load and become interactive for the user.

- **Accessibility** = Assesses how accessible a website is to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities, ensuring that content is accessible through screen readers and other assistive technologies.

- **Best Practices** = Evaluates the use of modern web development best practices aimed at optimizing website quality, including security, image optimization, and correct use of web standards.

- **SEO** = Analyzes a website's search engine optimization, checking for practices that improve a site's visibility to search engines and its compliance with SEO guidelines, such as meta tags and descriptive link text.

High Google Lighthouse scores signify a website's excellence across multiple dimensions of web development, including performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

### Jamstack Helps Achieve These High Scores

By running Lighthouse, and using Jamstack build tools, I'm able to improve a website's experience, page load times, accessibility for users with disabilities, search engine visibility, and overall user experience.

Lighthouse makes good recommendations on how to evaluate and enhance the quality of websites and applications. Jamstack can meet these recommendations and so it's become an indispensable resource for building modern, user-centric web projects.

## What Benefits Do These Scores Deliver?

### Increased Page Speed

The cornerstone of Jamstack's appeal to marketers lies in its use of static page generators, which serve pre-built webpages to users with lightning speed. This methodology drastically cuts down the loading time for pages, ensuring that potential customers encounter no hindrances when trying to access content, products, or services. In today's digital age, where the competition for user attention is fierce, the immediacy offered by Jamstack is invaluable. Swift page loads are instrumental in lowering bounce rates and fostering user engagement, which, in turn, significantly boosts conversions and, ultimately, revenue.

Adopting Jamstack and its static page generators inherently endows websites with unmatched speed and reliability, dramatically enhancing a site's search result rankings. This increased visibility is a boon for marketers, allowing them to extend their reach, amplify brand awareness, and attract more organic traffic. Thus, the efficiency and rapidity Jamstack brings to the table are key to crafting a digital marketing strategy that is not only more effective but also more lucrative.

### Higher Search Engine (SEO) Visibility

Adherence to best practices and SEO optimization are further bolstered by Jamstack's architecture. It encourages the use of HTTPS, content security policies, and efficient asset delivery—factors that contribute to a site's best practices score. Moreover, Jamstack's static nature makes websites more crawlable and indexable by search engines, improving SEO scores.

Enhanced SEO means increased visibility, higher traffic, and, ultimately, more conversions. In summary, high Google Lighthouse scores, facilitated by Jamstack, are indicative of a well-rounded, quality website that excels in performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO, offering tangible benefits to businesses and developers alike.

### Accessibility Helps Everyone

Accessibility is another critical area where Jamstack contributes positively. By fostering the development of websites with clean, semantic HTML and encouraging the use of modern web technologies, Jamstack facilitates the creation of more accessible websites.

This not only broadens the potential audience by making content accessible to users with disabilities but also aligns with legal and ethical standards for web accessibility. High accessibility scores reflect a commitment to inclusivity, enhancing a brand's reputation and user satisfaction.

### Security & Maintainability to Sleep at Night

By reducing reliance on dynamic server-side processes, Jamstack sites minimize potential attack vectors, making them inherently more secure. For marketers, this means less downtime and fewer security concerns, which could otherwise negatively impact brand reputation and user trust.

### Summary of Jamstack Benefits

In summary, Jamstack offers a compelling mix of performance, security, and flexibility, making it an ideal foundation for modern digital marketing strategies. The benefits to WRI extend across SEO, content delivery, user experience, security, accessibility, and operational efficiency, providing a platform that will withstand the rigors of many years of service.
