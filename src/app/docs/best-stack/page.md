## WRI 2024 and Google Lighthouse

Jamstack delivers performance, but how do we know it when we see it? Well, for one, the site looks professional. It reacts quickly to inputs. Objects stay in one place when the page loads. The website looks and works well on any device. It's easy to to use and many more things. Google went so far as to categorize what factors it considers websites must have to ensure a great user experience.

### The Test Scores

Google Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool designed to improve the quality of web pages. It provides audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO, and adherence to best practices. 

#### Areas of Measure:

- **Performance** = Measures the speed and overall responsiveness of a website, focusing on the time it takes for content to load and become interactive for the user.

- **Accessibility** = Assesses how accessible a website is to a wide range of users, including those with disabilities, ensuring that content is accessible through screen readers and other assistive technologies.

- **Best Practices** = Evaluates the use of modern web development best practices aimed at optimizing website quality, including security, image optimization, and correct use of web standards.

- **SEO** = Analyzes a website's search engine optimization, checking for practices that improve a site's visibility to search engines and its compliance with SEO guidelines, such as meta tags and descriptive link text.

High Google Lighthouse scores signify a website's excellence across multiple dimensions of web development, including performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

### Jamstack helps achieve these high scores

By running Lighthouse, and with using Jamstack build tools, I'm able to improve a website's experience, page load times, accessibility for users with disabilities, search engine visibility, and overall user experience. 

Lighthouse makes good recommendations on how to evaluate and enhance the quality of websites and applications. Jamstack can meet these recommendations and so it's become an indispensable resource for building modern, user-centric web projects.
