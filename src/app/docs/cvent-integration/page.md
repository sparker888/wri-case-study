### Cvent Integration Details 

#### What is Cvent?

Cvent is recognized for its comprehensive event management capabilities, offering tools for managing attendees, speakers, and venues. It's a go-to platform for event planners worldwide due to its versatility and depth of features.

#### Registration Configuration

Diving into Cvent for the WRI 2024 event, I quickly set up the foundational elements needed for our event's registration. This involved specifying event dates, selecting our venue, defining admission items, and establishing a pricing structure. The process was streamlined, albeit intensive, requiring a keen attention to detail to ensure a seamless registration experience.

#### Diverse Registration Types

To accommodate the varied needs of our attendees, I created multiple registration types. This customization allowed us to offer tailored registration experiences, catering to the different categories of participants attending the event.

#### Speaker Profiles

The addition of speaker profiles was crucial in enriching the event's content. By creating detailed profiles and linking speakers to our event website, we made it easier for attendees to connect with the thought leaders presenting at the conference.

#### Session Management

Incorporating both mandatory and optional sessions into our agenda, I explored various methods for listing sessions. This flexibility enabled us to craft an engaging and informative program for our attendees.

#### Admission Items and Pricing

Building specialized admission items and setting up pricing were key steps in refining the event's offerings. These tasks ensured that we could offer a range of options to meet attendee preferences and budget constraints.

#### Limitations of Site Designer

While attempting to replicate a specific design in Cvent's Site Designer, I encountered significant limitations. Although accessing the option to input custom code provided some relief, the pressing deadline necessitated a pivot back to our reliable Jamstack solution. This experience solidified our decision to continue leveraging Jamstack due to its flexibility and the constraints observed within Cvent's Site Designer.

#### Registration Process Customization

Customizing the registration process for different attendee types was a priority. This ensured that each attendee had access to personalized options, enhancing their registration experience.

#### Seamless Registration Form Integration

The integration of Cvent's registration form into our external website was remarkably straightforward, thanks to Cvent's embed feature. Their support team's dedication to ensuring a seamless fit within our registration page was commendable, resulting in a flawless integration that complemented our event's setup.

In conclusion, our journey with Cvent for the WRI 2024 event, from setting up basic registration components to overcoming design challenges, underscored the platform's robustness and our team's adaptability. Despite the hurdles, the outcomes were immensely rewarding, setting a strong foundation for future events.

## Additional Cvent Services

There are three additional services Cvent offers that WRS can support at a profitable markup. But first, we should look at Cvent's speaker management system. We should decide if this is a tool worth training on. 

### Speaker Management System

### Attendee Hub

Cvent has an Event App that allows both in-person and virtual attendees to stay connected. The app is fully integrated into the Cvent Attendee Hub, making it a seamless mobile extension of your event. Regardless of whether your 
event is in-person, virtual, or hybrid, the Event App is an effective engagement tool. We already have a designed component on the WRS draft website we can look at again together.
