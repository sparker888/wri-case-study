## We Achieved our Goals!

We have Achieved our Key Goals for the New WRI Website:

#### A. Better Promote and Sell the WRI Conference

#### B. Improve Information Organization & Event Registration

#### C. Design a system for Easy Replication year after year to have an Archive

#
## Expanding on these Goals

### Improved Design and Branding

I feel that the design meets the objective of improving the promotion and sales of the WRI Conference to our key audiences. As a team, we have achieved this by enhancing the event's branding, visibility and appeal.

### Streamlined Information and Registration Process

Another objective met was improving the organization of information and re-engineered the registration process, offering a more intuitive user experience from start to finish. I believe the combination of seminar about information, a graphical focus on the registration categories and tiers, and the methodical registration signup process from Cvent achieve this objective.

### Ability to Clone the Code Base for Annual Conferences

By building the codebase with the popular React library using Git Version Control we can immediately replicate the codebase year over year in a matter of minutes. This provides a means of archiving old content effectively as each year will be it's own separate website, but it has many other benefits even beyond this objective.

### Content Management System: Empowering Editors

Each year, the biggest challenge to updating the website for the annual conference is speakers bios & and abstracts. With integrating Storyblok CMS, now anyone can edit speakers, bios & abstracts and publish to our live produciton site! Other portions of the site are set up to be enabled as well should we choose to.

## Additional Objectives

As we conclude the project, I am pleased to report we have achieved or are in the process of achieving a number of additional objectives, which are summarized here:

1. **Rapid Loading Speed:** We achieved swift website load times, consistently delivered across the globe via an Edge Network, ensuring that visitors experience minimal latency.

2. **Cost Efficiency:** Despite the initial investment required for a Jamstack website setup, we have effectively reduced the ongoing operational costs, realizing the promise of running the site at lower expense.

3. **User Satisfaction:** Across all devices — desktop, tablet, and phone — we ensured a smooth and responsive user experience, leading to greater satisfaction among site visitors.

4. **Composable Architecture:** We successfully integrated the website into a larger ecosystem of modular components and microservices, which paves the way for effortless future upgrades and service integrations.

5. **SEO and Higher Rankings:** Our efforts resulted in the website achieving high scores in Google's performance metrics, which will improve WRI's search engine positioning over time.

6. **Key Content Editing:** We provided editors with a user-friendly, browser-based CMS experience as a demo of Storyblok, facilitating a seamless content management experience without the necessity of developer assistance.

7. **Enhanced Security:** By going with a static Jamstack and Netlify hosting we fortified the website's security posture, ensuring it is not susceptible to the vulnerabilities that traditional server-centric platforms often face.

8. **Reduce Privacy Exposure** Create verbiage to add to the site that helps protect the company against lawsuits stemming from a lack of proper disclosure of the website's privacy policy.

9. **Long-Term Benefits:** The foundation we have built guarantees that the benefits, including those not explicitly listed here, will extend for years to come with minimal maintenance.
