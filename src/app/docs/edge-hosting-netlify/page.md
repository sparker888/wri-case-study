## What is Edge Hosting?

Edge Hosting represents a transformative approach to web content delivery by situating servers closer to users around the globe, thus minimizing latency and maximizing performance. Unlike traditional hosting, which relies on a central server, edge hosting spreads website data across a vast network of servers, ensuring that content is delivered from the nearest possible location to the end user.

### Netlify

Netlify is at the forefront of modern web development, offering edge hosting services that are optimized for the Jamstack architecture. By providing a platform for developers to deploy their websites directly to a global delivery network, Netlify ensures fast loading times and enhanced security. Their serverless functions and continuous deployment from Git streamline the web development process, making it a go-to solution for developers aiming for efficiency and performance.

### The magic of auto redeploys

One of the revolutionary features of platforms like Netlify is auto redeploy: a system that automatically updates our live website whenever changes are pushed to GitHub. This CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) feature simplifies developers' workflow, allowing for immediate updates and rapid iteration, which is invaluable in a fast-paced development environment. The auto redeploy mechanism ensures that your content is always up-to-date, reflecting the latest changes without manual intervention, thus maintaining your website's freshness and relevance.
