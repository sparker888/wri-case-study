## What is Edge Hosting?

Edge Hosting represents a transformative approach to web content delivery by situating servers closer to users around the globe, thus minimizing latency and maximizing performance. Unlike traditional hosting, which relies on a central server, edge hosting spreads website data across a vast network of servers, ensuring that content is delivered from the nearest possible location to the end user.

### Netlify

Netlify is at the forefront of modern web development, offering edge hosting services that are optimized for the Jamstack architecture. By providing a platform for developers to deploy their websites directly to a global delivery network, Netlify ensures fast loading times and enhanced security. Their serverless functions and continuous deployment from Git streamline the web development process, making it a go-to solution for developers aiming for efficiency and performance.

### The magic of auto redeploys

One of the revolutionary features of platforms like Netlify is auto redeploy: a system that automatically updates our live website whenever changes are pushed to GitHub. This CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) feature simplifies developers' workflow, allowing for immediate updates and rapid iteration, which is invaluable in a fast-paced development environment. The auto redeploy mechanism ensures that your content is always up-to-date, reflecting the latest changes without manual intervention, thus maintaining your website's freshness and relevance.

## Managing the Netlify Account

![Netlify Dashboard](/images/netlify-dashboard.png)

I understand the importance of seamless collaboration and streamlined web operations for your projects. My company's Netlify account management allows for flexible access controls, ensuring that your team can work with autonomy and efficiency, whether through direct access to my account or by setting up your own.
#
**Important:** Updates are made to the GitHub repository. Those changes are seen by Netlify and it redeploys those changes quickly upon each push.


### Access to the Netlify account

I can offer a developer seat on my Netlify account which enables the seat to manage hosting settings, deploy sites, and monitor performance just as I do. 

### Creating a WRS account

If you prefer independent management at zero or near-zero cost, I'm happy to set up a Netlify account for WRS which offers full control over the WRI hosting environment. It's a straightforward process and team members can be provided with different levels of access. For more information, see [Netlify's website](https://www.netlify.com/).
