## GitHub Code Repository

GitHub is a cloud-based service that stores the WRI 2024 website's code, allowing for collaborative updates and version tracking. It acts as a central hub where the code can be safely managed and maintained over time.

### Accessing the WRS account

To access the WRS account on GitHub, you need to log in with the credentials provided on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/gravital-digital/Misc-Info-9b85c074a4d34c4cab1821bf41e47982?pvs=4). Once logged in, you can navigate the repository, view the code, track changes, and download the project.

## Understanding Git Version Control

Git is the technology underlying GitHub, providing the tools to support version control, which is vital for tracking and merging changes to the code over time. It ensures that updates are systematically managed and that the history of changes is preserved.

### Perfect for Ongoing Development

Git's version control is ideal for handling ongoing changes to the WRI website. It allows multiple team members to work on the code simultaneously, with a structured approach to merging updates and resolving any conflicts that may arise. There are a large number of developers that work in React/Jamstack.

### WRI Versions in Future Years

Envisioning multiple annual WRI events, the plan is to clone the code repository each year, building a rich codebase that serves as an archive of past events. This approach will allow WRS to access historical content while continuously enhancing the website's features and user experience.
