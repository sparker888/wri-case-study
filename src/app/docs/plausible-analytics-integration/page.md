## Choosing an Analytics Provider

The selection of Plausible Analytics as our provider is a strategic decision to uphold user privacy while still gaining valuable insights. Their data collection model is respectful of user consent, aligning with global data protection regulations and providing a transparent analytics approach.

### The Problem with Google Analytics

Traditional analytics services like Google Analytics often require the use of cookies, leading to complex consent management and potential privacy concerns. Plausible Analytics stands out by not using cookies, which means we can offer a clean, user-friendly experience without compromising on data quality or site performance.

## Putting that Data to Work

I have set up automatic reporting going to the team weekly and monthly so we can see what leads to influxes in traffic. As such, I'll continue to highlight areas for improvement. The WRI website's performance is always under watchful eyes.

### Basic Analysis

Gravital provides fundamental analysis and reporting as part of our service package. This includes traffic trends, referral sources, and basic user behavior metrics, giving us a snapshot of the site's health and performance.

### Creating Goals and Funnels

For those interested in deeper insights, we offer advanced tracking services. This includes setting up specific goals, measuring conversions, and analyzing funnels to streamline marketing efforts. While basic reporting is included in our retainer, more detailed analysis can be provided with an adjusted scope of hours.
