    description: Ensuring continuous and streamlined support for event management and website maintenance.
---

In my role at Wheel Rail Seminars, I am dedicated to providing continuous improvements and support as necessary. Regularly adding content and functionality to the website is an integral part of my responsibilities, and I will persist in assisting WRS in these endeavors. I anticipate that maintaining the WRI website will require minimal, yet crucial, effort. Specifically, we need to strategize our actions following the replication of our website template for future WRI events.

## Annual Event Resets

The foundation has been set. We have established a platform and process utilizing Jamstack and Git for version control to annually replicate our website design. This process necessitates setting up a new event in Cvent with updated event details and registration information (e.g., pricing adjustments). On the website, we must update time-sensitive content, including location, hero images, and dates. Given that details about speakers and sponsors will be determined later, we need to plan how to effectively manage initially blank pages and other important details.

### Archive Management

With WRI 2024 as our template in a Git repository and live on Netlify, we have prepared for future archiving. Annually, we can seamlessly link to the previous year's event, including speakers, bios, and abstracts.

To improve branding, enhancing the archive page to reflect the new website's design post-WRI 2024 is advisable. I suggest designing a new archive page that complements the new websiteâ€™s aesthetics.

## Maintenance and Future Changes

Routine updates are crucial for the upkeep of any digital platform. I will manage these updates as required, ensuring the website's functionality and security. I also have some suggestions on how we can extend the use of Storyblok and Cvent in the future.

### Periodic Technology Updates

As technology evolves, occasional updates to our software stack, including React and Next.js, will be necessary. While our current setup requires minimal maintenance, we should allocate several hours annually to this function, with additional time for significant platform updates, which typically occur every one to two years.
