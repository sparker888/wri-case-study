    description: Ensuring continuous and streamlined support for event management and website maintenance.

In my role at Wheel Rail Seminars, I am dedicated to providing continuous improvements and support as WRI splits from one conference into two. For years the conference has included speakers and attendees from both heavy haul and rail transit segments of the industry. In doing so, the company has [recently announced](https://wheel-rail-seminars.com) the locations for what will now be known as WRI 2025 HH and WRI 2025 RT for the Heavy Haul conference in Kansas City in June and the Rail Transit conference in Kansas City in the Fall.

## Annual Event Resets

Building WRI 2024 established a platform and process utilizing Jamstack and Git for version control to create a codebase set up for smooth replication year after year. This process includes setting up a new event in Cvent, but we're able to clone the event configuration year after year and tweak the registration information (e.g., pricing and description adjustments). On the website proper, we updated update time-sensitive content, including location, hero images, and dates. The speakers will come later in the year, but you can see what we have on the newly cloned sites here:

### Archive Management

The WRI 2024 Jamstack redesign not only serves as our template in a Git repository and live on Netlify, but it will now serve as an archive. Each year we wrap up the event by adding the presentations to the Bios & Abstracts section that attendees can access year after year.

WRI 2028 Honolulu is not a real event! It's just a dream...

## Jamstack Maintenance

No site lasts forever and some routine updates are necessary for the upkeep of any digital platform. I manage these updates, ensuring the website's continued functionality and security, but they are somewhat minimal compared to many legacy website setups. This is one of the beautiful things about working with services such as Storyblok and Cvent - they manage their own systems for us.

### Continuous Improvement

The WRS/WRI team is already working on future improvements. This summer we're adding image galleries, testimonials and announcements to the WRI 2025 websites. Jamstack and Git Version Control make it easy for us to try new features using component-based architecture. Stay tuned for more.
