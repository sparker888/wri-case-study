# Executive Summary

![We Broke Records!](/images/gravital-slide-wri.png)

## We broke multiple attendance records!

Welcome to the Wheel Rail Interaction (WRI) 2024 case study. This case study showcases the transformation of the engineering event website that began early in 2023 and culminated with the WRI 2024 Conference held in Chicago during May 2024. At that time, the vision was to enhance the brand, better showcase event speakers, improve the technical performance make it easier for users to navigate and register for the event.

At the conclusion of the event, we not only achieved our key goals for the website, but we drove increases in our core KPIs including increasing traffic by 12%, boosting conversions by an impressive 23.5%, and drive a remarkable 32% rise in overall attendees to the event. And we broke records! The Rail Transit Seminar and the Principles Course had their highest registration on record!

## First, quick introductions

![The Team!](/images/wrs-seattle.png)

I'm so honored to be working with the talented [WRS Team](https://sparker888.com/articles/joining-forces-with-wheel-rail-seminars). The leaders, marketers and designers helped enhance my skills as a modern web developer to create WRI 2024 online. The new website's success is due largely to a team effort.

## What is the WRI Conference?

![WRI VIPs](/images/wri-team.png)

The Wheel Rail Interaction conference was created and built on the idea that the rail industry can only make progress in solving its most difficult challenges, and becoming the best version of itself, if there is free and open communication across the boundaries of traditional organizational silos.

![WRI Audience!](/images/wri-audience.png)

Wheel Rail Seminars has excelled in creating events and environments in which there is a positive and open dialogue between personnel involved in rolling stock, track, operations, and management. Updates and ideas are shared between railways, suppliers, consultants, researchers, and regulators. Connections are made and conversations opened between some of the most junior and some of the most experienced members of our industry.

# Envisioning a new WRI website

As with any successful website redesign project, we carried out our work based on accomplishing my three general rules as a website producer. Keep the design centered around the user experience, keep the tech as simple as possible for performance and integrate features where it makes sense. I like to use the term Light. Speed. to represent a fast website built with streamlined tech to for flexibility. Most importantly, the system has to be secure, reliable, compliant and low maintenance.

![We Broke Records!](/images/wri-audience.png)

First and foremost for the Wheel Rail Interaction Conference's new website, the site needed an update in both technology and UX for a more user-centered design. In addition, information was difficult to get to and registration was convoluted, so we streamlined information organization, navigation and simplified a complicated, multi-pronged registration processes. Then we enhanced the message and branding of the event itself while keeping to its roots, to create a more engaging experience!

# Working with Wheel Rail Seminars

First and foremost, the site needed an update in both technology and UX for a more user-centered design. In addition, information was difficult to get to and registration was convoluted, so we streamlined information organization, navigation and simplified a complicated, multi-pronged registration processes. Then we enhanced the message and branding of the event itself while keeping to its roots, to create a more engaging experience!

As a team, we established several objectives early that would guide the entire process:

*A. Better Promote and Sell the WRI Conference*

*B. Improve Information Organization & Event Registration*

*C. Design a system for Easy Replication year after year to have an Archive*

![WRI crowd photo](/images/wri-crowd.jpg)

### Improved Design for Usability and Branding

The new design of the WRI website needed to not only improve usability in terms of being fast and easy to navigate, but support a longer-term objective of improving the reach of the WRI Conference message to our key audiences. As a team, we have achieved this by enhancing the event's branding elements and visual appeal (working on this now - need to explain how we expanded reach).

### Streamlined Information and Registration Process

Another important objective involved improving the organization of information and re-engineering the registration process, offering a more intuitive user experience from start to finish. I believe the combination of updated seminar information, registration category and tier graphics, and the configuration of the registration signup process from Cvent achieves this objective.

![Light. Speed.](/images/speed.png)

### Ability to Clone the Code Base for Annual Conferences

Building the WRI website codebase with the popular React library using Git version control provides us with important benefits. During the build, using version control allowed us to set up a draft website for content review before going live. This same system will enable us to replicate the codebase year over year and go back to see old sites at any point in time. Most importantly, Git will serve as our means of cloning the codebase for each annual event, saving us valuable time while preserving an archive of past events.

![Flexibility.](/images/flexibility.png)

### Providing Editors the Power to Edit Website Content Directly

One of the most time consuming tasks in updating the WRI website for each annual conference is adding the speaker bios & and abstract content. To meet this objective of providing editors with direct access to edit this content, we now have a content management system (CMS) that holds the speakers, bios & abstracts information so it can be edited using a simple online text editor.

![Reliability.](/images/reliability.png)

## A Note on Management Perspective

As a business owner myself, I'm always concerned about the bottom line. I'll go into more detail deeper into the case study, but some of the features of the new technology I work with helps to check off a lot of boxes when asked  about by my clients. I help make sure they happen:

#

1. **User Satisfaction**

2. **Rapid Loading Speed**

3. **Perfect SEO and Higher Rankings**

4. **Composable Architecture**

5. **Cost Efficiency**

6. **Editor Access**

7. **Enhanced Security**

8. **Reduced Privacy Exposure**


## Project Phases

The WRS team worked through five project phases to deliver the project. These phases are:

- Phase 1 - SITE CONTENT
- PHASE 2 - SITE CONCEPT & DESIGN
- PHASE 3 - SITE DEVELOPMENT (Build)
- PHASE 4 - SITE REVISIONS
- PHASE 5 - Site Launch & Project Wrap Up

More details on each phase are available deeper in tht case study, and I'll go into them a bit deeper on my socials during Summer 2024.

## Project Highlights

#### Mapping the User Journey

The team reviewed both analytics and user flow through the site to determine how we could improve its organization, particularly for the registration process. Using our notes, wireframes and user flow diagrams, we designed the look and feel of the main pages. We kept recognizable brand elements, yet created a design system that would enable future iteration.

![Journey](/images/wireframe-wri.jpg)

#### Concepts and Wireframes

For the sake of brevity, I'm just going to jump through some of the key highlights of the redesign project just share some .I'm skipping past discovery and whiteboarding some branding concepts and jumping to an image of a few wireframes that help us to organize and proportion the content for the design phase.

![Wireframes](/images/wireframe-home.png)



#### Project Build

Once the website design 'on paper' was approved, I built the site using the React which is a web development framework that enables me to create code that conforms to Jamstack principles. This was accomplished in several phases where, in general, I would develop a template page, share a draft of the page for comments and changes, then fine tune and polish it for production. This was repeated over and over again for each page, section and sometimes even particular UI elements. This culminates in a round of testing them launch!

![WRI Chicago Header](/images/wri-chicago-header.jpg)

### Key Integrations

Our project has successfully integrated essential services to enhance the WRI 2024 website's functionality and user experience. Namely, we integrated Cvent's registration system and Storyblok for speaker and topic management, a popular Content Management System (CMS) and Plausible Analytics. Here are a few highlights:

![Cvent Logo](/images/cvent-logo.png)

### Cvent Integration

![Cvent Registration Screen](/images/cvent-register.png)

Using Cvent's Event Registration system, we were able to configure the event to streamlined attendee registration for WRI 2024. This process was not straightfoward due to WRI's unique way of combining days into distinct packages for two tiers of attendees. Ultimately we did find a way to configure the event to that users can quickly review options and select the combo of days that best fit their interests. Cvent's forms work well for us as they are dynamic based on user selections, ensuring a seamless and secure registration experience.

#### Cvent Training

![Cvent Training](/images/cvent-academy.png)

Upon signing our contract with Cvent, I became involved in extensive onboarding and training sessions. This was led by the efforts of Abhishek Kumar who provided a four-week timeline of courses that gave me the necessary skills for basic Event Management configuration. I'm excited to work with the organization and look forward to further training'.

#### WRI 2024 Event Setup & Configuration

![Cvent Configuration](/images/cvent-admission.png)

The configuration of the WRI 2024 event in Cvent was meticulously handled, from defining registration types and adding speaker profiles to incorporating sessions and admission items. As mentioned above, I had to undertake this with minimal training, so we had a bit of trial and error as the Cvent system is based on sessions versus days, but we landed on a solution that works well.

#### Integrating Cvent Registration

![Integrating Cvent](/images/cvent-registration-form.png)

The final step involved bringing Cvent's registration form into the WRI 2024 website. Fortunately, this process was nearly seamless, thanks to Cvent's embed feature. This allowed us to maintain the power of our Jamstack website while benefiting from Cvent's robust registration functionalities, culminating in an well-branded and user-friendly process.

![Storyblok](/images/storyblok.webp)

### Storyblok Integration

![Storyblok Editing](/images/storyblok-example-editing.png)
![Kevin Oldknow Page](/images/kevin-oldknow.png)

Storyblok transforms content management with its intuitive content management system (CMS), empowering just about anyone to update the WRI 2024 speakers without needing a developer. Its real-time editing and preview capabilities ensure accuracy and ease of use.

![Example Speakers](/images/storyblok-example-speakers.png)

By separating the management of speaker information from the website code, CMSs like Storyblok give editors the ability to control content on their timeline. As you can see in these images, it's quick and easy to create, edit and publish Kevin Oldknow's bio and abstract in a single form accessible in any web browser.

## Google's Lighthouse scores

WRI 2024 has excellent lighthouse scores including perfect 'Best Practices' and 'SEO' scores according to their methodology and results. We made some tradeoffs with the Performance and Accessibility scores as they are heavily affected by media and Javascript as well as stringent requirements for contrast that can affect brand colors. We're satisfied with these scores and I continue to monitor them as we add and remove both content and features.

![High Performance.](/images/lighthouse-score-performance.png)

## The technology stars behind the scenes

My company is uses a variety of powerful and flexible solutions together named Jamstack. JAM, coined by the CEO of Netlify,  Matt Biilmann, a few years ago comes from client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup. I'll go into more detail about it later, but what's most important for an executive summary is what it delivers:

![Jamstack](/images/powered-by-jamstack.png)

- Faster performance
- Enhanced security and UX
- Superior Lighthouse scores
- Reduced long-term costs
- Seamless integration capabilities
- Cost-effective Edge hosting and scalability

Designing and constructing a fully performant website leveraging this architecture necessitates expertise across multiple technologies, ensuring both administrative ease and an enriching content developer experience. Moreover, should your product experience a surge in popularity, the underlying CDN technology ensures seamless scalability to accommodate the increased traffic.

### Next.js: The React Framework for the Web

![React](/images/react.png)

Next.js significantly enhances web development by facilitating server-side rendering (SSR), which drastically accelerates page loading times by delivering fully rendered HTML directly to the browser. This not only augments user experience but also elevates SEO, as it renders content more easily indexable and crawlable. Thanks to features like automatic code splitting, developers can ensure that only the necessary JavaScript and CSS are loaded, further improving site speed. Next.js simplifies the development process by providing built-in CSS support and a fast refresh feature, enabling a more efficient and enjoyable coding experience. Its inherent scalability ensures that applications can expand without compromising on performance.

![Tailwind](/images/tailwind.webp)

### Built with TailwindCSS

TailwindCSS, renowned for its utility-first approach, empowers developers to directly build designs within their HTML. This methodology expedites the styling process, obviating the need for custom CSS, and facilitates the rapid development of responsive designs across various devices. The highly customizable nature of TailwindCSS's design system ensures consistent design throughout the project, while its integration with Next.js allows developers to seamlessly blend these styling benefits within a robust web development framework. The synergy between TailwindCSS and Next.js enhances both the developer experience and the performance of the application.

![GitHub](/images/github.webp)

### GitHub Repo

GitHub is Microsoft's code repository known and trusted throughout the world, and it's where we store our code. GitHub is home to over 200,000,000 code bases, both public and private. They uses a standardized system of code control called Git we utilize to manage the website's codebase.

Version control is indispensable in contemporary development workflows, particularly with GitHub, which streamlines collaboration by enabling changes to be tracked and reviewed. Integrating Next.js projects with GitHub not only optimizes the website work, but also ensures more streamlined updates and superior code quality, enhancing the the longevity of the code base.

![Netlify](/images/netlify.webp)

### Edge Hosting on Netlify

Hosting Next.js applications on Netlify presents numerous advantages, including widespread CDN distribution for accelerated content delivery and effortless scalability. Netlify's continuous deployment from Git automatically publishes updates across all branches, while its support for serverless functions enables dynamic functionalities without the complexity of server management. This amalgamation of Next.js and Netlify offers a potent framework for constructing and deploying fast, secure, and scalable web applications, underscoring the technological synergy that characterizes the WRI 2024 project.

### Summary of Jamstack Platform Benefits

By leveraging these technologies and practices, we crafted a high-performance, secure, visible, and composable website for this WRI 2024 event site. Constructed using Jamstack principles, it not only delivers exceptional user experiences and high Google Lighthouse scores but delivers where it counts - conversions and revenue. It's also designed for long-term performance. By cloning repos and reconfiguring content, new websites are created from the original template, year after year, serving as a dynamic conference archive, showcasing past event speakers, abstracts and presentations for posterity.
